/**
 A proxy acts as a convenient
 surrogate or placeholder for another object. A proxy can be used in many ways. It can
 act as a local representative for an object in a remote address space. It can represent
 a large object that should be loaded on demand. It might protect access to a sensitive
 object. Proxies provide a level of indirection to specific properties of objects. Hence they
 can restrict, enhance, or alter these properties.
